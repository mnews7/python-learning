Me learning Python syntax
This is just a place where I can toss up some files that show what I've been working on to learn some Python.


Fib-div is a function that accepts a number "n" and calculates the Fibbonaci numbers between 1 and n.

It then loops through and shows what each of those Fibbonaci numbers are divisible by excluding 1 and themselves.
